# Word History Features

## Overview
The SignSpeak application now includes enhanced word history functionality that tracks voice recordings and text inputs with timestamps and user information, and saves the logout date when users sign out.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Word History Data Structure
Each word in the history now includes:
- **Word**: The actual word spoken or typed
- **Timestamp**: When the word was added (ISO string format)
- **Type**: Whether it was input via voice (üé§) or text (‚å®Ô∏è)
- **User ID**: Associated user identifier
- **User Name**: Display name of the user who added the word

### 2. Persistent Storage
- Word history is automatically saved to localStorage
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Each user has their own separate history storage
- History is saved with user ID as key: `signspeak_history_${userId}`

### 3. Logout Date Tracking
- When a user logs out, the current timestamp is saved as `logoutAt`
- The logout date is displayed prominently in the Word History panel
- Shows "Last session ended: [date and time]" in a blue info box

### 4. Real-time Updates
- Voice recordings and text inputs are immediately added to history
- History is automatically saved whenever it changes
- Maximum of 10 words kept in current session history

### 5. Enhanced UI
- Word count display in the header
- Visual indicators for voice vs text input types
- Timestamp formatting (Just now, Xh ago, or date)
- User attribution for each word
- Clear logout session information

## Technical Implementation

### Components Updated
1. **WordHistory.tsx**: Enhanced to display new data structure
2. **AuthContext.tsx**: Added word history management functions
3. **HomePage.tsx**: Integrated with new history system
4. **Navigation.tsx**: Saves history on logout

### Key Functions
- `saveWordHistory()`: Saves current history to localStorage
- `getWordHistory()`: Retrieves saved history for current user
- `getLastLogoutDate()`: Gets the last logout timestamp

### Data Flow
1. User speaks or types a word
2. Word is added to history with metadata
3. History is automatically saved to localStorage
4. On logout, logout timestamp is added to history
5. On next login, history is restored with logout date displayed

## Usage
